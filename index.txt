Revanth Davuluri

I am a graduate student pursuing Master's in Applied computer science. I have been admitted for this spring 2019 and if everything goes good  I will obtain my Master's degree by fall 2020.

I completed my under graduation with computer science as major in Dhanekula Institute of Engineering and Technology, Vijayawada , India. which is nearby my Hometown. Before, attending this school I completed my first semester from university of Missouri - saint louis. playing Table-Tennis, soccer, cricket and Trekking are my hobbies.

After obtaining my Master's degree I want to see myself as a AI developer. If possible I would like to master each and every phase of software development and maintenance.
